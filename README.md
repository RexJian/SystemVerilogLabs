# SystemVerilogLabs
Construct a typical architecture of a SystemVerilog testbench
## Lab1
### Goal : Define a task called reset() to reset the DUT per spec
 In Lab 1, I completed the following tasks  
 1.Create the SystemVerilog testbench file for a Device Under Test(DUT)  
 2.Compile and simulate the SystemVerilog test program
